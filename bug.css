The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon bug related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.child .grandchild {
  color: green;
}

```

In this scenario, the `.child` element has its color explicitly set to red using the `!important` flag.  However, the `.grandchild` element, nested within `.child`, attempts to override this with the color green.  While you might expect green to override the red due to the higher specificity of `.child .grandchild`, the `!important` declaration on `.child` prevents this, leaving the text in `.grandchild` red.
