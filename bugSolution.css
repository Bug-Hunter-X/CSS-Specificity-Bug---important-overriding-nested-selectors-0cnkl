The solution involves removing the `!important` flag or using a more specific selector with higher specificity to override the parent's style:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red; /* Removed !important */
}

.child .grandchild {
  color: green;
}

/* Alternative solution with higher specificity to override red without !important*/
.child .grandchild {
  color: green !important; /* If absolutely needed */ 
}
```

By removing the `!important` from `.child`, the nested selector `.child .grandchild` now correctly applies its color green, demonstrating the correct behavior without the `!important` flag.
